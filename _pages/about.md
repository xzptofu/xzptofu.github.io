I'm a fourth year undergraduate student from the [School of Computer Science](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/), [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/). I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Lijun Zhang](https://ai.nju.edu.cn/zlj/index.htm) of [LAMDA](https://www.lamda.nju.edu.cn/CH.MainPage.ashx) Group, led by [Prof. Zhi-Hua Zhou](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/zhouzh/index.htm).
